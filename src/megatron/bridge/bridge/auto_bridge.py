class AutoBridge:
    """
    Automatically select and instantiate the appropriate bridge for a model.

    This class examines the model configuration and selects the first bridge
    that supports it. No dynamic discovery or decorators are used - all bridges
    must be explicitly imported and added to the _BRIDGES list.

    The AutoBridge provides a user-friendly interface similar to HuggingFace's
    Auto classes, allowing seamless model loading without needing to know the
    specific bridge implementation required for each model architecture.

    Example:
        >>> from megatron.bridge import AutoBridge
        >>> # Load a Llama model without knowing it needs CausalLMBridge
        >>> bridge = AutoBridge.from_hf_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3-8B")
        >>> # Automatically returns a CausalLMBridge instance

        >>> # Works with local paths too
        >>> bridge = AutoBridge.from_hf_pretrained("/path/to/model")

        >>> # Check if a model is supported before loading
        >>> if AutoBridge.can_handle("microsoft/phi-2"):
        ...     bridge = AutoBridge.from_hf_pretrained("microsoft/phi-2")

        >>> # Pass additional arguments to the underlying bridge
        >>> bridge = AutoBridge.from_hf_pretrained(
        ...     "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf",
        ...     torch_dtype=torch.float16,
        ...     device_map="auto",
        ...     trust_remote_code=True
        ... )

    Note:
        Currently supports CausalLM models. Additional model types can be
        supported by implementing the appropriate bridge and adding it to
        the _BRIDGES list.
